	   public boolean isEmpty() 
	   function: checks for an empty tree
	   input: none
	   precondition: the tree has been created
	   output: true if the tree is empty, false otherwise
	   postcondition: true if the tree is empty, false otherwise

	   function: find the node that contains searchKey
	   input: searchKey
	   precondition: the tree has been created, no duplicate keys allowed
	   output: true if searchKey is found in the tree, false otherwise
	   postcondition: true if searchKey is found in the tree, false otherwise
	   				  if true, curr points to the node and parent to its parent
	   				  if false, curr is null and parent points to the logical parent
	   				  of a node with searchKey
	   				  
	   	public NodeInfo retrieveNode(String searchKey)
	   	function: retrieves the information part of the node containing searchKey
	   	input: searchKey
	   	precondition: the tree has been created, no duplicate keys allowed
	   	output: the information part of the node containing searchKey, if found, 
	   			null otherwise
	   	postcondition: returns the information part of the node containing searchKey
	   			if searchKey found in the tree, returns null otherwise
	   			
	   	public void add(String keyIn)
	   	function: a node with info part containing keyIn is created and inserted in the tree
	   			if the key is not found there alredy
	   	input: the key to be inserted
	   	precondition: the tree has been created
	   	output:
	   	postcondition: a node containing keyIn has been created and inserted in the tree.
				curr points to this new node and parent to its logical parent. If a node 
				with keyIn was found in the tree, the tree is left unchanged. curr points to 
				this node and parent to its parent.
				
		public void deleteNode(String searchKey)
		function: delete the node containing searchKey
		input: the key for the node to be deleted
		precondition: the tree has been created, no duplicate keys allowed
		output:
		postcondition: the node containing searchKey has been deleted from the tree. curr is 			
				set to null. parent points to the parent of the deleted node. If the node to
				be deleted was not found in the tree, curr is null and parent points to the
				logical parent of a node with searchKey.
				
		public void inOrder(BSTNode root) // recursive
		function: traverse the tree in inOrder (sorted in ascending order)
		input: the root of the tree to be traversed
		precondition: the tree has been created
		output: the key parts of the information parts, in order, to standard output
		postcondition: the keys are printed in (ascending) order
		
		public void preOrder(BSTNode root) // recursive
		function: traverse the tree in preOrder (node first, then its children)
		input: the root of the tree to be traversed
		precondition: the tree has been created
		output: the key parts of the information parts, in preorder, favoring left, to 	
				standard output
		postcondition: the keys are printed in preorder, favoring left, to 	
				standard output

		function: traverse the tree in postOrder (children first, node last)
		input: the root of the tree to be traversed
		precondition: the tree has been created
		output: the key parts of the information parts, in postorder, favoring left, to 	
				standard output
		postcondition: the keys are printed in postorder, favoring left, to
